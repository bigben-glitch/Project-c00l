        <p>This competition is the easiest of the three and it started with barcelona beating athletic club 2-0. In the final where an el classico happened we saw barca go down in the first 5 minutes and in the 20th minute lamine yamal equalized and after that barca went on to score 4 more goals and madrid only scored one more so the final score was 5-2 with barca winning the competition</p>
